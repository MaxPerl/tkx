Tkx.pm
------

The Tkx module provide yet another Tk interface for Perl.  Tk is a GUI
toolkit tied to the Tcl language, and Tkx provide a bridge to Tcl that
allows Tk based applications to be written in Perl.

The main idea behind Tkx is that it should only be a thin wrapper on
top of Tcl, i.e. that what you get is exactly the behaviour you read
about in the Tcl/Tk documentation with no surprises added by the Perl
layer.

Tkx has been used to implement ActiveState's PDK tools.

In order to install Tkx, you will need to have Tcl/Tk and the Tcl.pm
module installed.  Installation otherwise follow the normal drill:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
